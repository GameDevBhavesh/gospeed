# Gospeed (Api client with godot)
<!-- 
JSON Configuration File is a plugin for Godot that aims to aid reading user input via a JSON file. Using a JSON file as a way to configure your Godot application would allow your users to share configuration files. Minecraft is a remarkable example that uses JSON files to configure certain aspects of the game, such as block models.

The definition of JSON Schemas inspired this plugin. However, instead of using a JSON file to define the structure of a JSON, it takes a coding approach. This approach has the advantage of allowing more features.

## Code example

When using this plugin, you would be able to set up a configuration file with code like this:
![Code example](./doc/images/code_example.png)
This code would verify that this JSON file is valid:
![Valid JSON](./doc/images/valid_json.png)
And it would also detect multiple errors in this JSON file with a single validation process:
![Incorrect JSON](./doc/images/incorrect_json.png)
Please, check the [documentation](./doc/README.md) to learn how to set up your own JSON configuration file.-->
